## Product Description

The Recovery Drawdown MT4 is an Expert Advisor (EA) designed to help traders overcome trading drawdowns by implementing a recovery strategy. It aims to secure profits and reduce losses through a series of actions.

### Features

- Maximum Loss Percentage: The EA allows users to define the maximum loss percentage that triggers the recovery process. By default, it is set to 10%.
- Profit Target: Users can set a minimum profit percentage required to secure profits. The default value is 5%.

### How it Works

1. **Initialization**: The EA initializes by retrieving the current account balance, calculating the maximum drawdown, and tracking the total profit.

2. **OnTick**: This function is called on every tick. It performs the following actions:
    - **Close Winning Trades**: The EA checks if there are any winning trades and closes them to secure profits.
    - **Close Losing Trades**: The EA checks if there are any losing trades and closes them if the loss exceeds the maximum loss percentage defined by the user.
    - **Check Recovery Completion**: The EA checks if the recovery process is complete by comparing the current account equity with the initial account balance. If the equity is greater or equal, the recovery process is considered successful, and the EA is removed.

3. **CloseWinningTrades**: This function iterates through all open trades and checks if they are winning trades. If a trade is winning, it is closed, and the total profit is updated.

4. **CloseLosingTrades**: This function iterates through all open trades and checks if they are losing trades. If a trade is losing and the loss percentage exceeds the user-defined maximum loss percentage, it is closed, and the total profit is updated.
